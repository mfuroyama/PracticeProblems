# Triangle Maker! (C Edition)

## Assignment
For this problem, we'll create a virtual triangle maker. Building on what you've learned so far in C, we'll create
a program that:
1. Reads in 3 angle values, in degrees
2. Determines if the three angles actually can actually form a triangle, and if not print out ("not a triangle")
3. If the angles make up a valid triangle, print out the type of triangle created ("isoceles", "scalene" or "equilateral")

### Exercise
Pull the latest `master` branch, then:
```
> cd problem6
```

From there, open the file. Don't worry about the code yet. For now, we'll focus on compiling. To do this, run the following from the terminal:
```
> cc triangles.c -o triangles
```

This will compile your code into an executable.

To run the code, enter the following in the terminal:
```
> ./triangles
```
