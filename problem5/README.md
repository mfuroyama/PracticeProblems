# Hello World! (C Edition)

## Assignment
For this first problem, all I want you to do is get comfortable with some new concepts:

### Compiler
C introduces the concept of a **compiler**. The compiler takes your code, and converts it into "machine language". This is unlike Javascript, which is an _interpreted_ language. To get a C program to run, you'll have to perform 2 steps:
1. Compile your code
2. Run your code

### Exercise
Pull the latest `master` branch, then:
```
> cd problem5
```

From there, open the file. Don't worry about the code yet. For now, we'll focus on compiling. To do this, run the following from the terminal:
```
> cc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld
```

This will compile your code into an executable.

To run the code, enter the following in the terminal:
```
> ./helloWorld
```
